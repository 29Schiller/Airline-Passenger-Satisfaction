      This project presents a scalable system for predicting airline passenger satisfaction using big data techniques and machine learning. By leveraging PySpark‚Äôs distributed processing capabilities, the application processes high-dimensional flight data efficiently. The system incorporates a complete pipeline‚Äîfrom data acquisition and transformation to predictive modeling‚Äîoptimized for performance and reliability. The insights generated aim to support airlines in tailoring customer service strategies and enhancing operational decision-making based on predictive analytics.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## 1. **Introduction** üìã

<div style="text-align:justify">
This chapter outlines the methodological approach undertaken in developing a flight passenger satisfaction prediction system. The project employs a data-driven machine learning pipeline implemented using PySpark, a distributed data processing framework well-suited for large-scale computations. The primary objective of the system is to predict the likelihood of passenger satisfaction based on a variety of in-flight and service-related attributes, enabling stakeholders‚Äîparticularly airlines‚Äîto make informed, data-backed decisions to improve customer service quality. The methodology is divided into four major components: use case analysis, architectural and model design, and implementation strategy. The application offers dual functionality, allowing users to submit individual passenger data for real-time predictions or upload structured datasets in CSV format to perform batch prediction and analysis

## 3. **Features** ‚ú®
- Manual Input Prediction : Designed for end-users, this interface allows users to manually input key passenger and flight-related information (e.g., age, travel class, service ratings). Upon submission, the system processes the data and immediately returns a prediction indicating whether the
passenger is likely to be satisfied or not.
- CSV Prediction: Tailored for analysts or operational staff, this interface enables users to upload a structured CSV file containing multiple passenger
records. The system then performs batch processing to generate satisfaction predictions for each entry and returns a downloadable file with results, along with summary visualizations.

## 4. **Requirement** :dart:
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)
- Pyspark 
- Hadoop

```

## 6.Setup
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/29Schiller/Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction>
   cd AirlinePassengerSatisfaction
   ```
2. **Install Java** (required for PySpark):
   - Ensure Java 8 or 11 is installed (e.g., `openjdk-11-jdk` on Linux or equivalent on Windows/macOS).
3. **Download data**:
   - Download `AirlinePassengerSatisfaction.zip` and unzip it to the `data/` folder to get `train.csv` and `test.csv`.
   - In this repository, we have already downloaded and unziped the dataset for you.
4. **Run file by order**:
   - Run the Data_preprocess for a cleaned data.
   - Run the Pipeline.py for building the pipeline
   - Run python file for each model: LR, RF, MLP and GBT.
   - Run the App.py for the app in streamlit.


## 7. Training Models
To train models, use scripts in the `Model` folder. Example:
```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from Model.data_processing import load_data, preprocess_data
from Model.model_training import train_logistic_regression, evaluate_model

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("TrainModel").getOrCreate()
train, test = load_data(spark, "data/train.csv", "data/test.csv")
train_processed, test_processed, _ = preprocess_data(spark, train, test)
model = train_logistic_regression(train_processed)
evaluate_model(model, test_processed, "Logistic Regression")
spark.stop()
```
